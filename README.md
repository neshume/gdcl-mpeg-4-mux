GDCL Mpeg-4 filter
==================

It is a repository for the GDCL Mpeg-4 Multiplexor filter by Geraint Davies. 
You can download original source and binaries from http://www.gdcl.co.uk/mpeg4/

Original filters contain both mux and demux filters. This repository contains mux only. 

Build
======

* Add base classes to your project's include directories (it's `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Samples\multimedia\directshow\baseclasses` for me)
* Add Strmbase.lib or Strmbased.lib (build base classes to get it. Read more at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd318238(v=vs.85).aspx)
